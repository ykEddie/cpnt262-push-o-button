My brain was going completely blank during this assignment, I did what I believe was asked of me but I'm not sure if I understood the assignment correctly.

I did a little research to look for events other than click which didn't take too long to find, ended up using mouseover and mouseout.

- `document.addEventListener("mouseover")`
- `document.addEventListener("mouseout")`

[Event listener article](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp)

Not sure if I needed to add the mouseover and myFunction part into the p tag on the html page, but I don't think it affected it.
